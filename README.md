# Source code for the spoof LSPosed Module
On this branch you can find the source code for the spoof module

Do not use it to create illegal stuff!

Download the Xposed Library to build the module [here](https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/tree/gh-pages/de/robv/android/xposed/api/82), under the app folder create a folder named "lib" and put the library here, make sure its like this:


    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚app/ 

     â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚lib/
    
        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚de/
        
            â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚robv/
            
                â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚android/
                
                    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚xposed/
                    
                        â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„library files
                        

Also the spoofing propreties on the code has been removed, but you can add them for yourself, these are the Daydream-Ready Phones
- Pixel 3
- Pixel 3 XL
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL

- Mate 9 Pro
- Porsche Design Mate 9
- LG V30
- LG V35
- ZenFone AR

To get the ro propreties you need to extract the phone's rom and get the build.prop file

The module is **secure** because it doesn't collect private information, it just spoofs your phone as a Daydream-Ready Phone, you can check the code

**NO COPYRIGHTED CODE IS USED!, the code is from [RisenID's PixelSpoof LSPosed Module](https://github.com/RisenID/PixelSpoof/tree/caiman)**

It has been edited to make it work with Daydream VR
